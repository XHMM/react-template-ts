### This is a typescript react boilerplate
### Usage
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

This boilerplate includes some webpack plugins , you can get them all in `webpack.config.js`.  
 
You should notice that there is a `dev-dashboard` cmd in `package.json`, when i run it in the built-in terminal in `WebStorm` ,it not show the graph correctly, when I run it in my PowerShell or `vs code` built-in terminal, it's ok. so just use this script if not showing something unexpected.
### Testing
This boilerplate use `jest` and `react-testing-library` for testingï¼Œrun `npm run test`
